# Design firmware for an ESP32 DevKit V1 that implements a water level monitoring system using an analog water level sensor connected to an ADC pin. Based on the sensed water level, control an LED and a buzzer such that the LED turns ON and the buzzer sounds when the water level exceeds a defined threshold. Use non-blocking timing, include serial debug output at 115200 baud, optimise for low memory usage, and follow embedded best practices.
