# Design ESP32 DevKit V1 firmware using the Arduino framework that controls an LED connected to GPIO 2, blinking once every second using non-blocking timing (millis-based). The firmware should be memory-efficient, include serial debug output at 115200 baud, and follow embedded best practices (no long blocking delays). The solution should clearly define pin configuration, avoid unnecessary global variables, and be suitable for long-running operation on a resource-constrained ESP32 device.
